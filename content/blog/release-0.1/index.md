# Release 0.1 of the Coding Environment

We’ve just released the first version of the [Coding Environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/). This version features the ability to program the Wonder Workshop Dash robot to move forward, left, and right. We’ll build upon the Coding Environment adding new features with regular releases in the upcoming months. We’ve included a few activities in the Educator’s Toolkit for you to try. [Free play](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/free-play/),
[Robot on a mission](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/missions/), and
[Tracing shapes](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/tracing/) are fun ways to try out the Coding Environment!
