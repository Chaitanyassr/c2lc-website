# Release 0.1 of the Inclusive Coding Environment

We’ve just released the first version of the [Inclusive Coding Environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/). This version features the ability to create programs that control the movements of Wonder Workshop's Dash robot. We’ll build upon the Coding Environment, adding new features with regular releases in the upcoming months. We’ve included a few activities in the Educator’s Toolkit for you to try. [Free play](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/free-play/),
[Robot on a mission](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/missions/), and
[Tracing shapes](https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/tracing/) are fun ways to try out the Inclusive Coding Environment!
