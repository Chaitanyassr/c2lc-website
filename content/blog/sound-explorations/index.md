# Sound Explorations

Over the summer we visited several [summer camps](/blog/co-design-session-1/) where students had fun using our prototype to control robots and make art. While this was an engaging way to teach some programming fundamentals, some students were not able to use a keyboard and mouse. With this in mind, weâ€™ve been exploring how others can interact with our coding environment using sounds such as speech or clapping. Please check out the following video for more information.
