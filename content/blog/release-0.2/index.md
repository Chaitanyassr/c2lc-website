# Release 0.2 of the Inclusive Coding Environment

Weâ€™ve released the second version of the [Inclusive Coding Environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/). This release contains bug fixes and user interface refinements including:

- The "Delete All" feature which removes all steps from a program and allows a person to start fresh with an empty program
- Instructions on using the editor's Add and Delete buttons
- The Run button's disabled state visually matches other buttons and it is inverted (white on dark grey) when a program is being run
- The Run, Add, and Delete buttons use aria-disabled rather than the HTML disabled attribute to  ensure that they are accessible in the keyboard tab order when disabled
- Keyboard focus is retained while editing a program
